# NatureBlend App Architecture

## Overview

NatureBlend is designed as a dual-role mobile application serving both customers and vendors in the wellness marketplace. The application follows a modular architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns, making it maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend with new features.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is organized by user roles:

#### 1.1 Shared Components
- **Authentication Flow**: User type selection, login, signup, and password recovery
- **Splash Screen**: Initial app loading with branding elements
- **Common UI Components**: Reusable elements like buttons, inputs, and cards

#### 1.2 Customer Experience
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation for home, explore, cart, orders, and profile
- **Screens**: Dedicated screens for product browsing, details, cart management, checkout, order tracking
- **Components**: Customer-specific UI components and cards

#### 1.3 Vendor Experience
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation for dashboard, products, orders, analytics, and profile
- **Screens**: Dedicated screens for product management, order processing, analytics visualization
- **Components**: Vendor-specific UI components, charts, and data displays

### 2. Navigation Layer

The navigation architecture uses React Navigation with the following structure:

```
AppNavigator (Root)
├── SplashScreen
├── UserTypeScreen
├── AuthNavigator
│   ├── LoginScreen
│   ├── SignupScreen
│   └── ForgotPasswordScreen
├── CustomerNavigator (Bottom Tabs)
│   ├── HomeScreen
│   ├── ExploreScreen
│   ├── CartScreen
│   ├── OrdersScreen
│   └── ProfileScreen
└── VendorNavigator (Bottom Tabs)
    ├── DashboardScreen
    ├── ProductsScreen
    ├── OrdersScreen
    ├── AnalyticsScreen
    └── ProfileScreen
```

Nested navigation stacks are used within each main tab when needed (e.g., product details, order details).

### 3. State Management

NatureBlend uses a combination of local component state and React Context for global state management:

- **Local State**: Used for screen-specific UI states and form inputs
- **Context API**: Used for authentication state, shopping cart, user preferences, and theme
- **Async Storage**: Used for persisting user sessions and app preferences

### 4. Data Layer (Mock)

The current prototype uses mock data patterns to simulate interactions with a backend:

- **Static Data**: Pre-defined product catalogs and user information
- **Mock Services**: Simulated API calls with timeout delays for realistic UX
- **Data Utilities**: Helper functions for data transformation and preparation

### 5. Styling System

The app uses a consistent styling approach with:

- **Theme System**: Centralized color palette, typography, and spacing constants
- **StyleSheet**: Component-specific styles following React Native best practices
- **Responsive Design**: Flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Component Composition

UI elements are built from smaller, reusable components that can be composed to create more complex interfaces. This promotes reusability and consistency throughout the app.

### 2. Container/Presentational Pattern

Many screens follow the container/presentational pattern:
- **Containers**: Handle data fetching, processing, and state management
- **Presentational Components**: Focus purely on rendering the UI based on props

### 3. Feature-First Organization

The codebase is organized by features rather than types, making it easier to locate and work with related code.

## Extensibility Considerations

The architecture is designed to support future enhancements:

1. **Real Backend Integration**: Mock services can be replaced with actual API calls without changing the UI components
2. **Authentication Services**: Support for additional authentication methods like social login
3. **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateways for real transactions
4. **Push Notifications**: Framework for adding real-time notifications
5. **Analytics Integration**: Hooks for adding usage analytics and tracking

## Technical Debt and Considerations

For a production-ready application, consider addressing:

1. **API Error Handling**: More robust error handling and retry mechanisms
2. **Form Validation**: Comprehensive form validation throughout the app
3. **Accessibility**: Enhanced accessibility features and testing
4. **Unit Tests**: Test coverage for critical business logic
5. **CI/CD**: Automated build and deployment pipeline
